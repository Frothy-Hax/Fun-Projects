<h2><i><p style="background-color:black;">What is Ethical Hacking?</p></i></h2>
<h3><p style="background-color:black;">Ethical Hacking is the art of learning how to breach systems and expose security flaws in all kinds of cyber environments, from hosted web applications through to public facing remote desktop web portals. This might sound a lot like regular old hacking, but the key difference is pretty simple: Permission! An Ethical Hacker will always have permission to attack the servers or services they are testing, with the idea being they find the flaws before the bad guys do. Watch this short video below to find out what being an Ethical Hacker is all about.</p></h3>
