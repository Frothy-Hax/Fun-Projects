<h3><p style="background-color:black;">Hacktivism is a combination of hacking & activism, hence the name. It is usually done not for the usual hacker associated activity of monetary gain but more often than not to further a cause. Whilst some of the causes could certainly be argued for as being entirely justified, hacktivism is still illegal and can get you into significant trouble. In the UK it could land you with a maximum prison sentece of up to <a href="https://cyfor.co.uk/the-computer-misuse-act-and-cyber-crime/">14 years</a>, so anonymity is a must for Hacktivists!</p></h3>
